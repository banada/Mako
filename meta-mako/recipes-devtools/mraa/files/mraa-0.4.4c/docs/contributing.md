Contributing to libmraa                           {#contributing} 
======================

libmraa is an opensource project and we are actively looking for people to help
with:

- Writing platform supports for all types of embedded boards running linux
- People to write cool samples
- People to extend the functionality

The recommended method to contribute is to fork on github, and then send pull
requests to the main project. Questions can be also be asked and issues raised
on github.

If you'd rather not use github you are more than welcome to send git formatted
patches to brendan.le.foll@intel.com.
